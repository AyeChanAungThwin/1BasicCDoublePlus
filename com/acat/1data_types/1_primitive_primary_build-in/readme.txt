Primitive types: boolean, int, char, float, double, void, wild character

4 bits = 1 nibble
2 nibble = 8 bits
8 bits = 1 byte
2 bytes = 1 word
4 bytes = double word

Everything starts from nothing i.e., ZERO!

<Modifiers>
signed = can have both positive or negative values. (by default)
unsigned = must contains only positive values.
short = use half of the existing bits.
long = use twice of the existing bits.

<Notes>
float and double cannot have signed or unsigned types.

C++ support variables up to 8 bytes i.e., we only have 32 or 64 bit operating systems.
And there isn't available 128 bits operating system yet!
